    <h3>SHORT BIO:&nbsp;<a href="cv_sjy.pdf">cv</a></h3>
    My research interests lie in Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Data Mining. These days I am working on Wavenet (NLP with TensorFlow). Please feel free to have some discussions if you are interested.
    <br><br>
    I am currently a senior undergraduate student in <a href="http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/">Department of Computer Science and Engineering, School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai JiaoTong University</a>.
    <br><br>
    I worked in <a href="http://202.120.38.37/en/InstituteDetail.aspx?id=8">Advanced Computer Architecture Laboratory</a>, advised by Prof. <a href="http://202.120.38.37/en/PeopleDetail.aspx?id=160">Xiaoyao Liang</a> and Prof. <a href="http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~jiangli/">Li Jiang</a> since 2015. In Fall 2015, I worked on a project for <a href="http://202.120.38.37/en/InstituteDetail.aspx?id=9">Visual Media and Data Management Lab</a>. In Summer 2016, I was fortunate enough to worked as a research intern in <a href="http://vcla.stat.ucla.edu/">Center for Vision, Cognition, Learning, and Autonomy</a> in University of California, Los Angeles, advised by admired Prof. <a href="http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~sczhu/index.html">Song-Chun Zhu</a>.

                <p>RRAM Crossbar suffers various defects and variation, resulting in dramatic degradation of the yield and computation accuracy. Hardware based solutions cause large overhead and power consumption. The previous software based solution, however, cannot deal with stuck-at faults and is less efficient in large variations. We leverage the inherent sparse weight-matrix and self-tuning capability of the neural network to avoid assigning the large value weight to the memristor with defects and high variance. We explore the self-healing of the neural-network to enlarge the solution space of finding the fault tolerable weight-memristor mappings. To train the neural-network, in this paper, we apply the conven- tional back-propagation method that utilizes the gradient descent technique. To show our retraining process with fixed weight, we use a simple two-layer fully connect neural-network as an example.</p>

                <p>We first introduce feature detection sequence as KNN ratio test, symmetry test and RANSAC after basic SURF feature detection to get the most robust feature detector. A BruteForceMatcher obtains two nearest neighbors through comparing the descriptors that removes bad matches then further checked by DMatches to delete all non-symmetrical matches. Finally RANSAC returns the fundamental matrix. Experiments show 30 matches for threshold would be promising. We also introduce Lookup Table that stores 2D coordinates of current frame and its triangled 3D coordinates, then by keeping track of 2D-3D pair during each iteration of processing new frames we can minimizes projection errors. We quantify the effect of generated contour by fine points and observation. Experiments on real-world datasets show effectiveness of our algorithm and improvements.</p>

                <p>We track statistics both from texts and graphs by utilizing the hierarchical And-Or Graph to jointly represent the latent structure. New topics are detected through a cluster sampling process for which we adopted Swendsen-Wang Cuts for tracking. We generate topic trajectories to show how topics emerge, evolve and disappear over time. Experiments shown on both a public dataset Reuters-21578 and a self-collected dataset named UCLA Broadcast News Dataset. Results show that this method can explicitly describe the textual and visual data in news videos and produce meaningful topic trajectories.</p>

The document includes five parts: how to compile the Linux Kernel; module programing; process management (schedule records in times of process); memory management (a module create a proc file system which accepts 3 commands inputs); file system (study romfs including hide, encrypt and modify permission of files). <a href="https://github.com/ShenJiyuan/guide-for-linux-kernel-study" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>[Github]</a> <a href="projReport.pdf" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>[Tutorial]</a></p>

    <p>(2014) simple linux C codes for getting started. All codes were written when I was studying Operating System Class in SJTU including file copy, shell-like programing, threading and IPC problem implementations (BurgerBuddyProblem). <a href="https://github.com/ShenJiyuan/guide-for-linux-c" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>[Github]</a></p>

    <p>(2016) get started with Twitter REST API and Google Map API (similar to scrawler implementations). Here you will follow my steps including get one user's followers' id, their profile, image and location. Check if the locations are in US by Google Map. Count number of common followers of two users.<a href="twitter_scrawler.pdf" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>[Tutorial]</a><a href="https://github.com/ShenJiyuan/Twitter-Scrawler" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>[Github]</a></p>
   
    <p>(2016) get started with 3 multiprocessing tools (openmp, hadoop and pthread). The corresponding questions are (1) openmp and hadoop - matrix multipication; (2) pthread - there are four threads (thread 1 output 1, thread 2 output 2, thread 3 output 3, ...). <a href="https://github.com/ShenJiyuan/guide-for-multiprocessing-programming" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>[Github]</a></p>

    <p>(2015) get started with simple-scalar tool and use it as a method to take cache performance and optimazation study. I make the document when I was studying computer architecture class in SJTU, and I still remember that such materials online are few. The file introduces 'sim-cheetah' and 'sim-outorder' with SPEC95 benchmark 'go'. First, use 'sim-cheetah' as a cache simulator to investigate the set and associativity effects on miss rate. Second, further use 'sim-cheetah' to discuss the cache upon replacement policies (here focus on LRU and MIN algorithm). Third, use 'sim-outorder' to investigate the effects of branch predictors on the execution for the SPEC95 benchmark 'go'. <a href="arch1.pdf" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>[Tutorial]</a></p>
