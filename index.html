<p>I am currently a senior undergraduate student in <a href="http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Department of Computer Science and Engineering, School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai JiaoTong University</a>.</p>
<p>I worked in <a href="http://202.120.38.37/en/InstituteDetail.aspx?id=8" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Advanced Computer Architecture Laboratory</a>, advised by Prof. <a href="http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~jiangli/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Li Jiang</a> since 2015. In Fall 2015, I worked on a project for <a href="http://202.120.38.37/en/InstituteDetail.aspx?id=9" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Visual Media and Data Management Lab</a>. In Summer 2016, I was fortunate enough to worked as a research assistant in <a href="http://vcla.stat.ucla.edu/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Center for Vision, Cognition, Learning, and Autonomy</a> in University of California, Los Angeles.</p>
<p>My research interests lie in computer vision and data mining in graphs and complex networks, and their data driven applications to interdiscipline computations.</p>

<p>Supervised by <a href="http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~sczhu/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Prof.Song-Chun Zhu</a>, in the Department of Statistics, VCLA</p>
<p>We track statistics both from texts and graphs by utilizing the hierarchical And-Or Graph to jointly represent the latent structure. New topics are detected through a cluster sampling process for which we adopted Swendsen-Wang Cuts for tracking. We generate topic trajectories to show how topics emerge, evolve and disappear over time. Experiments shown on both a public dataset Reuters-21578 and a self-collected dataset named UCLA Broadcast News Dataset. Results show that this method can explicitly describe the textual and visual data in news videos and produce meaningful topic trajectories.</p>

<p>We first introduce feature detection sequence as KNN ratio test, symmetry test and RANSAC after basic SURF feature detection to get the most robust feature detector. A BruteForceMatcher obtains two nearest neighbors through comparing the descriptors that removes bad matches then further checked by DMatches to delete all non-symmetrical matches. Finally RANSAC returns the fundamental matrix. Experiments show 30 matches for threshold would be promising. We also introduce Lookup Table that stores 2D coordinates of current frame and its triangled 3D coordinates, then by keeping track of 2D-3D pair during each iteration of processing new frames we can minimizes projection errors. We quantify the effect of generated contour by fine points and observation. Experiments on real-world datasets show effectiveness of our algorithm and improvements.</p>

    <p>Designed and implemented a basic disk-like secondary storage server. Designed and implemented a inode-based file system to act as a client using the disk services provided by the server. Utilized the socket API to enable communication between the server and the file system. It reads in a set of data files specifying the scheduling and memory access behavior of programs, and will simulate the paging process of those programs.</p>

    <p>Actually this project includes four components with different difficulty. To develop MIPS CPU simulators with multi-cycle and pipeline.The simulator is constructed by using xilinx spartan 3e software and verilog language. (Reports are really detailed in implementing and principles. They are written by me two years ago, and I was not intended for putting in a way like github, which makes them all explained in Chinese.)</p>
